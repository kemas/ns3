# This simple example on how to do animations using graph-tool, where the layout
# changes dynamically. We start with some network, and randomly rewire its
# edges, and update the layout dynamically, where edges are rewired only if
# their euclidean distance is reduced. It is thus a very simplistic model for
# spatial segregation.
